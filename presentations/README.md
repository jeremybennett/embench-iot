# Embench Presentations

These are various slide decks for use when speaking about Embench.  They are
prepared using Sphinx/Hieroglyph, an open source technology that should be
universally acceptable.

## Installing Sphinx/Hieroglyph

### Linux

Standard Linux installations seem to be horribly out of date. Much better to use _pip_ or _pip3_. You do want the Python 3 version, so if your system has Python 2 as the default, use _pip3_
```bash
pip3 install -U sphinx
pip3 install hieroglyph
```
### Microsoft Windows

You will need to install Python 3. Then use _pip_ as for Linux

### macOS

To be written (pull requests welcome!)
